                  In software testing the ISTQB defines acceptance as: formal
                  testing with respect to user needs, requirements, and business
                  processes conducted to determine whether a system satisfies
                  the acceptance criteria and to enable the user, customers or
                  other authorized entity to determine whether or not to accept
                  the system. Acceptance testing is also known as user
                  acceptance testing (UAT), end-user testing, operational
                  acceptance testing (OAT) or field (acceptance) testing.

                    Gherkin is the language that Specflow understands. It is a
                    Business Readable, Domain Specific Language that lets you
                    describe software’s behaviour without detailing how that
                    behaviour is implemented.

                  A domain-specific language (DSL) is a computer language
                  specialized to a particular application domain. This is in
                  contrast to a general-purpose language (GPL), which is broadly
                  applicable across domains. There are a wide variety of DSLs,
                  ranging from widely used languages for common domains, such as
                  HTML for web pages, down to languages used by only one or a
                  few pieces of software, such as Emacs Lisp for GNU Emacs and
                  XEmacs.

                  <i>I do think that the greatest potential benefit of DSLs
                    comes when business people participate directly in the
                    writing of the DSL code. The sweet spot, however is in
                    making DSLs business-readable rather than
                    business-writeable. If business people are able to look at
                    the DSL code and understand it, then we can build a deep
                    and rich communication channel between software development
                    and the underlying domain. Since this is the Yawning
                    Crevasse of Doom in software, DSLs have great value if they
                    can help address it.</i>

                  A small example:
                  <pre><code class="gherkin">
  Feature: Some terse yet descriptive text of what is desired
    In order to realize a named business value
    As an explicit system actor
    I want to gain some beneficial outcome which furthers the goal

    Scenario: Some determinable business situation
      Given some precondition
      And some other precondition
      When some action by the actor
      And some other action
      And yet another action
      Then some testable outcome is achieved
      And something else we can check happens too

                  <h3>Keywords</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Feature: Some terse yet descriptive text of what is desired - starts the feature and gives it a title.</li>
                    <li>Scenario: Some determinable business situation - starts the scenario, and contains a description of the scenario.</li>

                <section>
                  <h3>Steps - Given</h3>
                  The purpose of Given steps is to put the system in a known state before the user (or external system) starts interacting with the system (in the When steps). Avoid talking about user interaction in givens. If you have worked with use cases, givens are your preconditions.
                </section>
                <section>
                  <h3>Steps - When</h3>
                  The purpose of When steps is to describe the key action the user performs (or, using Robert C. Martin’s metaphor, the state transition).
                </section>
                <section>
                  <h3>Steps - Then</h3>
                  The purpose of Then steps is to observe outcomes. The observations should be related to the business value/benefit in your feature description. The observations should inspect the output of the system (a report, user interface, message, command output) and not something deeply buried inside it (that has no business value and is instead part of the implementation).

                <section>
                  <h3>Tables</h3>
Tables as arguments to steps are handy for specifying a larger data set - usually as input to a Given or as expected output from a Then.

                  <pre><code class="gherkin">
